# Using `Dash`

In Nov25, we had a demo on using [`Dash`](https://dash.plotly.com/) to create webapps.

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
# [app.py](app.py)
This is the script we built.

```python
{{< include _app.py >}}
```
:::

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}
# [app_fancy.py](app_fancy.py)
This is a nicer looking dashboard demonstrating some of the things you could do to fix up the formatting.

```python
{{< include _app_fancy.py >}}
```
