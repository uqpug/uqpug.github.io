Or do we have to do sth else to change our working directory?\nThank you so much\n\n# Access the system (using the module sys)\nimport sys\n\n# This will display where you can put your modules\nprint(sys.path)\n\n# This will add another location to the path (another folder where you can load modules)\nsys.path = sys.path + ['Location of your modules']\n\nhttps://www.w3schools.com/python/python_ref_keywords.asp avoid to name your files or variables with these words or python will get confused!\n\nLuke attempting to find answers\nThe ‘translate’ module is causing a conflict - https://pypi.org/project/translate/\nThis says you can do pip install to file path? - https://stackoverflow.com/questions/63790682/importing-custom-modules-py-files-into-virtual-environment#:~:text=You%20can%20create%20a%20setup.py%2C%20then%20install%20this,a%20module%20by%20pip%20pip%20install%20-e%20%2Fpath%2Fto%2Ffolder\n\npip install translate\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 3 - should you always be using venv (virtual environments) for every new project? - Annie\nwhat are the pros and cons of venv?\n\n## Code for Q3\n\n\n\nQuestion 4 - where does one find packages available in Notable? e.g. google colab doesnt have all packages - Annie\nAdd more details here\n\n## Code for Q4\nhelp('modules')\n\n\n\nQuestion 5 - Why does it sometimes take so long to use google collab? (i.e when we have to re-run everything again) is it bcs it is run the server which is different from server that we use to run our code with other environment? do we have place to store our .csv file?\n\n## Code for Q5\n\n\n\nQuestion 6 - How do I fix an IndexError: list index out of range? -Taneesha\nWriting python code in ArcGIS to loop through a number of geoprocessing tools\n\nnumbers = [0,1,2]\n\nletters = [\"a\",\"b\"]\n\nfor i in numbers:\n    print(letters[i])\n\nQuestion 7 - do we have tools for running it line by line in spyder?\nLuke you mentioned you were interested in this - feel free to delete once you’ve seen this. https://www.deeplearning.ai/short-courses/langchain-chat-with-your-data/\nThanks Jason. I have a playlist of YTs to work my way through currently. Found a channel where one of the videos I had some success with. This video - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wrD-fZvT6UI. So am trying more of his tutorials. Trying to do it without OpenAI API",

    "text": "Questions\nIf you have any Python questions you’d like to explore with the group, please put them in a markdown cell, with any code you’d like us to run in a Python cell.\n\nQuestion 1 - Finding substrings for COVID sequencing - Note that the formatting has not transferred correctly here Nida\nNida has a problem where she needs to identify specific substrings from a large sequence of characters (DNA sequence). Her code is below\nI just found out that the code:\ncovid_seq = getSequence('MN908947', 'genbank', DNA_Alphabet)\nis actually trying to get a DNA sequence of covid from genbank & will give output of a string containing 29,900 characters (that we can actually see by clicking on the EBI website below)\nit is use a function called \"getSequence\" with code: `def getSequence(entryId, dbName = ‘uniprotkb’, alphabet = Protein_Alphabet, format = ‘fasta’, debug: bool = True):\nif not isinstance(entryId, str): entryId = entryId.decode(“utf-8”)\nurl =‘http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/dbfetch/dbfetch?style=raw&db=’ + dbName + ‘&format=’ + format + ‘&id=’ + entryId\ntry: if debug: print(‘DEBUG: Querying URL: {0}’.format(url))\ndata = urllib.request.urlopen(url).read() if format == ‘fasta’: return readFastaString(data.decode(“utf-8”), alphabet)[0]\nelse: return data.decode(“utf-8”)\nexcept urllib.error.HTTPError as ex: raise RuntimeError(ex.read())\n`#This function retrieves a single entry from a database (entryId: ID for entry e.g.’MN908947’, dbName: name of database e.g. ‘genbank’)\nonce we got that DNA string (consisting of only 4 types of characters-A/C/T/G), a biologist will translate them (into AminoAcid or Protein string, consisting 20 types of characters + asterisk/* , please see https://www.hgvs.org/mutnomen/codon.html). We’ll translate them using a dictionary (code not shown) and then we’ll split them based on * so that we can generate an output of a list of strings that is stored in a variable called “protseq” (see https://docs.google.com/document/d/1R22IGMfe9i1tYAlPK5ZSOikV-ON6xZVUq-C87xDMiLg/edit?usp=sharing )\nfinally, from that I need to find how many strings inside of that “protseq” that meet these criteria: 1) start with M 2) end with * 3) has length of &gt;=100 characters\nso, my question is actually: how to understand the logic behind the below code that is said to be able to do that job:\n#check first occurence of M in each string of that ‘protseq’ list &gt;&gt;where_M_in_protseq_1st-string = protseq[0].find(‘M’) print(where_M_in_protseq_1st-string) print(len(protseq[0]))\n#code to check whether each string in that ‘protseq’ start with M and &gt;= 100 &gt;&gt;cnt = 0\n\n\nfor i in protseq: &gt;if len(i) - i.find(“M”) &gt;= 100: &gt;&gt;cnt +=1\n\n\n\n\nprint(cnt)\n\n\n\n\nfor seq in protseq: &gt;m_pos = seq.find(“M”)\n&gt;m_end_seq = seq[m_pos:]\n\n\n\n\n\nif len(m_end_seq) &gt; 100: &gt;print(m_end_seq) &gt;print(len(m_end_seq))\n\n\n\nThe answer for this problem should be 8 strings inside 18 members of that protseq list will meet that criteria (so if we can end up getting 8 from that code we are correct)–&gt; (but I just hope that I can get it correct and understand how the code works)\nImportance: from that 8 strings, we can try 1 of them in a real protein database (called Uniprot-KB) and know what part of covid body that is likely to interact with human and causing disease\nThank you very much\n\nimport urllib\n\nclass Alphabet():\n    \"\"\" A minimal class for alphabets\n        Alphabets include DNA, RNA and Protein \"\"\"\n    def __init__(self, symbolString):\n        self.symbols = symbolString\n    def __len__(self):              # implements the \"len\" operator, e.g. \"len(Alphabet('XYZ'))\" results in 3\n        return len(self.symbols)    # will tell you the length of the symbols in an Alphabet instance\n    def __contains__(self, sym):    # implements the \"in\" operator, e.g. \"'A' in Alphabet('ACGT')\" results in True\n        return sym in self.symbols  # will tell you if 'A' is in the symbols in an Alphabet instance\n    def __iter__(self):             # method that allows us to iterate over all symbols, e.g. \"for sym in Alphabet('ACGT'): print sym\" prints A, C, G and T on separate lines\n        tsyms = tuple(self.symbols)\n        return tsyms.__iter__()\n    def __getitem__(self, ndx):\n        \"\"\" Retrieve the symbol(s) at the specified index (or slice of indices) \"\"\"\n        return self.symbols[ndx]\n    def index(self, sym):\n        \"\"\" Retrieve the index of the given symbol in the alphabet. \"\"\"\n        return self.symbols.index(sym)\n    def __str__(self):\n        return self.symbols\n\n\"\"\" Below we declare alphabet variables that are going to be available when\nthis module (this .py file) is imported \"\"\"\nDNA_Alphabet = Alphabet('ACGT')\nRNA_Alphabet = Alphabet('ACGU')\nProtein_Alphabet = Alphabet('ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY')\nProtein_wX = Alphabet('ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWYX')\nProtein_wGAP = Alphabet('ACDEFGHIKLMNPQRSTVWY-')\n\n\ndef getSequence(entryId, dbName = 'uniprotkb', alphabet = Protein_Alphabet, format = 'fasta', debug: bool = True):\n    \"\"\" Retrieve a single entry from a database\n    entryId: ID for entry e.g. 'P63166' or 'SUMO1_MOUSE'\n    dbName: name of database e.g. 'uniprotkb' or 'pdb' or 'refseqn';
