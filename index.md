- In-person at UQ Central Library 12-N109

## How it works

Each month, we gather at UQ Central Library to help solve each other's problems and discover new features. We begin with a brief demonstration before diving into group discussion.

Bring along your python questions, problems, conundrums, opinions and victories to share with the group. We'll try our best to help you out!
